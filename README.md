# Introduction

This repo is my NeoVim configuration for macOS.
`init.lua` is the config entry point for terminal Nvim.

My configurations are documented to make it as clear as possible.
While you can clone the whole repository and use it, it is not recommended though.
Good configurations are personal. Everyone should have his or her unique config file.
You are encouraged to copy from this repo the part you want and add it to your own config.
